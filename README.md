#Reasons for using this bot

Personally I really like the clearly represented weather forecast graphs, which are provided by www.dmi.dk, but on a mobile device they are not easy to reach with the browser and I am not pleased by current apps for this service.
So by implementing this bot I got the chance to really get the raw graphs, which <b>saves</b> my <b>time</b>, system <b>resources</b> on my mobile device and <b>data volume</b> from my mobile provider. 

#Tutorial

I am willing to publish a tutorial, which describes the technologies, which have been used during this project.

You might also want to reuse the de.simonscholz.telegrambot.model java project, because it contains all model classes, which are currently available as Telegram API: https://core.telegram.org/
